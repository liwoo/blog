# Should You Buy an EV in Malawi?

Electric Vehicles: to some, the inevitable future that will eventually sweep away the rusting relics of internal combustion engines; to others, a high-tech gamble teetering on the edge of practicality and idealism.  Whichever camp you belong to, they are here, and they are here to stay.  So, should you buy an EV in Malawi today?  Let'd dig in.

To understand the full context of EVs, we need to dial the clock back a couple of hundred years.  It becomes clear then that there is only so far we can go with literal horsepower.  Scientists and Engineers are in a frenzy to invent the technology that will propel us into the 20th Century.  And way before the gas guzzling engines we enjoy today, a chap called William Morrison makes a breakthrough with EVs in 1890.

However, political maneuvering, global agendas, and the muscle of oil moguls consigned EVs to the backseat, much like a Bright Nkhata single forgotten but not gone. The combustion engine stole the limelight, leaving electric vehicles humming quietly in the background, waiting for their eventual comeback tour.

## The Winds of Change
But as it was in the beginning, is now, and possibly ever shall be. Within the last couple of decades, the narrative has pivoted dramatically. Climate change isn't just an environmentalist's rallying cry anymore; it's as real and in-your-face as Hurricane Freddy.  And as the sea levels shift, so does the political climate.  With that apocalyptic backdrop, the Toyota Prius enters the scene as the precursor to the promised one.  Alas today, from the megafactories of Shenzen, a new car is born.

## Advantages of EVs
So, what are EVs and what are they good for? See when you step on your accecelarator today, your peciuos fuel is injected into your engine's combustion chamber.  Now, the fuel mixes with air, and then your spark plugs ignite the mix, pushing the pistons and turning the cankshaft.  And the wheels of your bus go round and round.

But with Electric, its a whole different ballgame.  You push the pedal, and instead of fuel and air mixin' it up, you have ESCOM from your battery flowing to the electric motor. And as the motor spins, so do your wheels.

No lining up on the fuel queue.  No buying expensive spare parts every two months. The only things you have to maintain are you breaking, suspension, body and electronics!

## Bringing it Home
Today, Tesla is by far the top dog in Electric Car sales and innovation.  But China is catching up, and catching up quick! With an emphasis on affordable, entry-level EVs, packed with exciting tech such as voice assisted commands and full blown Karaoke in your car, Chinese brands are slowly becoming an realistic first EV option for most in developing markets.

I've actually test driven a couple of BYDs myself, and even though Xeng Peng is the true symbol of Luxury, the value for money on these Chinese vehicles is becoming harder and harder to ignore, epsecially when you consider that there's very little competitive advantage that your tranditional German models bring to the table when it comes to EVs.

## The Challenge
But is Malawi ready? That's the million MW question. My short answer is no!

The first barrier is both cultural and economic.  Most of us just don't have the disposable income to pay $30,000 cash on a vehicle, even if its brand new. And for those that can, they would much rather by a 2022 second-hand 7 Series Beamer: its just a louder status symbol!

Then there's the issue of expetise - or rather, the lack if it.  Let's face it, if your EV's start acting up, good luck finding - and funding - a technician who can tell a lithium-ion battery from a car radio.

And don't get me started on power supply. You must pray that a monkey doesn't render our grid useless.  Because when it does, its going to be bananas for you.

As for our roads, let's just say there's a lot of patching up to go. Then you have the actual charging infrastructure. I can go on and on.

Sigh! I'm not trying to dampen your mood.  If you can get your hands on a descent charging station at home, if you can find an SUeV with 500KM Range, and adequate clearance.  If you have access to a trained EV technician, you can make it happen.  But you would be going against the grain.

## Opportunities
Where I see there are glaring opportunities today is in public mobility.

### e-Bikes
Let's talk about eBikes. They are affordable, practical, and could fit perfectly into the PayGo business model. Imagine a system where kabaza passengers pay per ride, just like they do with mobile data. I'm talking about bundles for bikes. A system where the Kabaza driver doesn't own the bike, he simply leases it, and pays a monthly bill per use.

### e-Buses
Next up are e-Buses. Not only does their large footprint allow us to pack more batteries in them, they're monumental in potential impact. With a single e-Bus, you can ferry dozens of people around town, all while keeping the carbon footprint, maintenance costs, and the cost of transporation low.

### e-Farming Vehicles
Finally, e-farming.  With Agriculture being a staple to our economy, some of the biggest impact could lie in an agriculture electric revolution, and e-Farming vehicles could be the first wave. From e-tractors that plough fields, and e-bikes that propel alangizi further into remote villages, to e-drones that monitor crop health, the sky's the limit. With fewer moving parts, e-Farming vehicles often have lower maintenance costs and higher efficiency. Modern e-Farming vehicles can be coupled with advanced technologies like GPS, IoT sensors, and even AI algorithms. This results in precision farming where you can monitor and control every aspect of your farming operations, right from your smartphone. Paired with renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, e-Farming vehicles can make a farm energy-independent, reducing reliance on the grid or fuel.

## In Conclusion
Malawi might not be ready for an individual electric car revolution just yet, but the opportunities in public mobility are ripe for the picking. So, if you're an investor, policymaker, or even an everyday citizen looking to make a difference, this is where you might want to set your sights. We have the chance to leapfrog over decades of infrastructure neglect and urban sprawl to create a public transportation system that's not just adequate, but exemplary. Let's not miss the bus on this one, shall we?
