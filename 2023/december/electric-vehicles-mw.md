# Should You Buy an EV in Malawi?

Electric Vehicles: to some, the inevitable future that will eventually sweep away the rusting relics of internal combustion engines; to others, a high-tech gamble teetering on the edge of practicality and idealism.  Whichever camp you belong to, they are here, and they are here to stay.  So, should you buy an EV in Malawi today?  Let'd dig in.

To understand the full context of EVs, we need to dial the clock back a couple of hundred years.  It becomes clear then that there is only so far we can go with horsepower.  Scientists and Engineers are in a frenzy to invent the technology that will propel us into the 20th Century.  And way before the gas guzzling engines we enjoy today, William Morrison makes a breakthrough with EVs in 1890.

However, political maneuvering, global agendas, and the muscle of oil moguls consigned EVs to the backseat, much like a Bright Nkhata single forgotten but not gone. The combustion engine stole the limelight, leaving electric vehicles humming quietly in the background, waiting for their eventual comeback tour.

## The Winds of Change
But as it was in the beginning, is now, and possibly ever shall be. Within the last couple of decades, the narrative has pivoted dramatically. Climate change isn't just an environmentalist's rallying cry anymore; it's as real and in-your-face as Hurricane Freddy.  And as the sea levels shift, so does the political climate.  With that apocalyptic backdrop, the Toyota Prius enters the scene as the precursor to the promised one.  Alas today, from the megafactories of Shenzen, a new car is born.

## Advantages of EVs
So, what are EVs and what are they good for? See when you step on your accecelarator today, so get fuel injected into your engine's combustion chamber.  Now, the fuel mixes with air, and then your spark plugs ignite the mix, pushing the pistons and turning the cankshaft.  And the wheels of your bus go round and round.

But with Electric, its a whole different ballgame.  You push the pedal, and instead of fuel and air mixin' it up, you have ESCOM from your battery flowing to the electric motor. And as the motor spins, so do your wheels.

No lining up on the fuel queue.  No buying expensive spare parts every two months. The only things you have to maintain are you breaking, suspension, body and electronics!

## Bringing it Home
Tesla is by far the top dog in Electric Car sales and innovation.  But China is catching up, and catching up quick! With an emphasis on affordable, entry-level EVs, packed with exciting tech such as voice assisted commands and full blown Karaoke in your car, Chinese brands are slowly an approachable first EV in developing markets.

I've actually test driven a couple of BYDs myself, and even though Xeng Peng is the Chinese symbol of Luxury, the value for money on these Eastern vehicles is becoming harder and harder to ignore, epsecially when you consider that there's very little difference with your tranditional German moedls when it comes to EV.

## The Challenge
But is Malawi ready? That's the million MW question. My short answer is no!

The first barrier is both cultural and economic.  Most people just don't have the disposable income to afford a $30,000 vehicle, even if its brand new. And for those that can, they would much rather by a 2022 second-hand 7 Series Beamer: its just a louder status symbol!

Then there's the issue of expetise - or rather, the lack if it.  Let's fac it, if your EV's start acting up, good lick finding - and funding - a technician who can tell a lithium-ion battery from a car radio.

And don't get me started on power supply. You must pray that a monkey doesn't render our grid useless.  Because when it does, its going to be very awkard.

As for our rodad, let's just say there's a lot of patching up to go. Then you have the actual charging infrastructure.  

Sigh! Look, I'm not trying to dampen your mood.  If you can get your hands on a descent charging station at home, if you can find an SUV with 500KM Range, and adequate clearance.  If you have access to a trained EV technician, you can make it happen.  But you would be going against the grain.

## Opportunities
Where I see there are glaring opportunities today is in public mobility.
