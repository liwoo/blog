# Malawi’s Grand Plan to Achieve Digital Health Interoperability

The year is 2035. The sun casts a warm glow over the scenic Chitipa District. The air is filled with a palpable sense of excitement and hope. Here, in the heart of Malawi, the future of Digital Health Interoperability isn't a mere dream—it's a lived reality.

Blessings, a resident of Chitipa, finds herself in need of medical attention. With trepidation, she arrives at the newly established Chitipa District Hospital, having recently transferred from Chinsansu Clinic. The nurse at the reception, without wasting a moment, accesses Blessings' comprehensive medical history, treatments, and past records from Chinsansu with just a few clicks. The once daunting process of transferring medical data has been transformed into a seamless experience.

After her consultation, Blessings is immediately informed of her diagnosis, which is securely shared with her insurance provider, MASM. Without missing a beat, MASM processes the data, calculates any shortfalls in her coverage, and sends Blessings a real-time notification detailing the exact amount due. Blessings, relieved and grateful, finalizes the payment effortlessly through Airtel Money.

This isn't science fiction. This is the new reality for the citizens of Malawi—a future where healthcare is no longer hampered by bureaucratic hurdles or data silos. A future where patients like Blessings can transition between healthcare facilities with ease, confident in the knowledge that their health records will follow them.

## Kuunika Data for Action: The Beginning

Between the summer of 2017 and 2019, I had the honor of working as a Software Architect for Kuunika Data for Action. This was not just any project; it was a consortium of pivotal health stakeholders, including Baobab Health Trust (BHT) – my duty station – Luke International Norway, Cooper Smith, and Lighthouse Trust.

### Our Mission

Our primary objective was clear and challenging: establish Digital Health Interoperability in Malawi to enhance the continuum of care among patients. Collaborating with technical partners like Jembi Health Trust, we brainstormed, designed, and envisioned what interoperability in Malawi's healthcare would entail.

### A Global Community

Our team was actively involved in the OpenHIE Community, where we both contributed to and learned from global industry partners. This international collaboration was instrumental in gaining insights and sharing best practices.

### Baobab Health Trust's Legacy

BHT's work in building localized EHR Systems, inspired by OpenMRS, for specific disease programs was commendable. By the time I joined, BHT's low-power solutions were operational in over 95 health facilities across 12 Malawian districts. Their offline-first patient identification system, DDE, had successfully registered over 6 million patients.

### Integrating the Fragmented Landscape

With a strong foundation in place, the challenge was integrating Malawi's fragmented Digital Health Landscape. The solution? OpenHIE's reference architecture. Our first major task was to create a Master Health Facility Registry, meticulously documenting all 1,500 healthcare facilities in Malawi.

### Pioneering Work

Following the facility registry, our focus shifted to the Terminology Registry. A pilot project was launched with 10,000 terminologies translated to both Snomed and ICD-10. We also initiated the development of an ADX to ensure seamless data integration between DHAMIS and DHIS2 every month via the interoperability layer.

## The Road Ahead

While we've achieved commendable milestones in our journey toward a seamless Digital Health landscape in Malawi, the path ahead is filled with even more possibilities, nuances, and revolutionary breakthroughs.

The envisaged Health Worker Registry is not merely a database; it's the backbone of our healthcare system. It's crucial for identifying and documenting every individual who plays a part in patient care. From nurses and doctors to pharmacists and lab technicians, this registry ensures that every hand that contributes to a patient's well-being is recognized. In doing so, it not only establishes a structured hierarchy of care but also promotes accountability, ensuring that every health worker delivers to the best of their ability.

A comprehensive Terminology Service is the unsung hero of interoperability. In the vast world of medicine, where a single term can have varied interpretations, this service acts as a bridge. It ensures that all medical-related terms, be it a symptom, a diagnosis, or a treatment protocol, are translatable not just between systems, but across borders. By harmonizing medical vocabulary, it eradicates ambiguity, ensuring that a doctor in Chitipa District understands a diagnosis made in Lilongwe in the same vein, making patient transfers and cross-regional treatments seamless.

But what's the magic behind ensuring that all this data flows without friction? Enter FHIR - Fast Health Interoperability Resources. As an indispensable standard, FHIR doesn't just act as a conduit for information transfer; it's the gatekeeper of a new realm in Digital Health. With FHIR, our healthcare system is not just conversing within its borders but is poised to engage in a global dialogue, sharing insights, learning from global best practices, and continuously evolving.

And as we talk about data, its sanctity can't be overlooked. The encoded, encrypted data, once perceived as mere bytes and bits, holds the life stories of millions. The Ministry of Health, by having visibility and governance over this treasure trove, ensures its sanctity. It's not just about managing data; it's about stewarding a nation's health narrative. With every record, the Ministry isn't just seeing numbers; they're foreseeing trends, making informed decisions, and preemptively addressing health concerns before they become widespread issues.

In essence, as we march forward, we're not just building systems; we're weaving the fabric of a healthcare utopia where every Malawian, from the bustling streets of Blantyre to the serene landscapes of Chitipa, has access to unparalleled healthcare, powered by the might of digital innovation.
